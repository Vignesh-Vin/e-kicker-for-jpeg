# JPEG Resaver

## What is this
A little program to save you from Whatsapp's JPEG hell.  
Can be used when Photshop doesn't want to open your JPEG files that you just downloaded from Whatsapp :)  

## How to use  
Just drag the images you want to convert to .jpg  

## Why is this
There are already a lot of ways to solve this issue, so why did I make this?  

Because the other methods take a lot of time and effort, and some involve moving all files to a seperate folder and collecting output from another folder. But it's way too much work if you just want to use it for fewer images. 

This program allows you to quickly drag & drop your images and it does the rest of the things.
And it has a GUI (cool i guess).
