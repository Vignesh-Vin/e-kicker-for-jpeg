# JPEG Resaver  
*A little program to save you from "JPEG marker is missing" hell (for images downloaded from Whatsapp)*  

A tool to re-encode JPEG/JPG files to JPG.  

## How to use  
Just drag the images you want to convert to .jpg  

## Why is this
There are already a lot of ways to solve this issue, so why did I make this?  

Because the other methods take a lot of time and effort, and some involve moving all files to a seperate folder and collecting output from another folder. But it's way too much work if you want to use it for a few images frequently. 

This program allows you to quickly drag & drop your images and it does the rest of the things.
And it has a GUI (cool i guess).  

## A few things to note
If you want to mess with it:  
```  
This program is written in Python 3.9.6 (32-bit)  
```
### Dependencies:  
```  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
This will install the following Python Modules  
 - Pillow  
 - Tkinter  
 - TkinterDnD2
