# JPEG Resaver

## What is this
A little program to save you from Whatsapp's JPEG hell.
Just drag the images you want to convert to .jpg
This program converts .jpeg files to .jpg with a GUI.

Can be used when Photshop doesn't want to open your JPEG files that you just downloaded from Whatsapp :)

(more features coming soon)
